Business Insights Dashboard – Tableau Project

Project Overview

I developed a comprehensive Business Insights Dashboard using Tableau to analyze sales performance across shipping modes, regions, product sub-categories, customer segments, and geographic locations.
This dashboard provides a clear visual story of business operations and reveals actionable insights that can guide strategic decision-making.

🎯 Key Insights

Standard Class is the most used shipping method with $6.87M in sales.

Same Day generates fewer orders but is often linked with high-value items.

Shipping speed does not always mean higher profit.

📅 Sales Over Time

Sales trend shows fluctuations across Q1–Q4 in all regions.

Central and East regions remain the strongest performers.

🗺 Revenue by State

Revenue is concentrated in a few high-performing states.

Low–performing regions present opportunities for targeted marketing or distribution improvements.

📦 Product Performance

Chairs and Phones are the highest-selling product categories.

Storage and Binders bring in steady revenue but show potential for optimization.
